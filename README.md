# PDPA Shield

Regex-based data masking for banking logs — Theory of Computation (ToC) assignment.

A web application that finds personal data in a bank's log files and masks it according to PDPA rules,
using **only Python's `re` module** for detection and masking.

| Data | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Credit card | `1234-5678-9012-3456` | `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-3456` |
| Email | `somchai.d@company.com` | `s*******d@company.com` |
| Phone | `093-245-7894` | `XXX-XXX-7894` |
| Date of birth | `DOB:25/12/2549` | `DOB:XX/XX/25XX` |
| Address | `Address: 689 ซอย… ถนน… แขวง… เขต… กรุงเทพฯ` | `Address: XXX ซอย… ถนน… แขวง… เขต… กรุงเทพฯ` |

## Status

This is the **team skeleton**. Every module has an owner, a spec in its docstring, and acceptance tests.
Unimplemented stubs raise `NotImplementedError`, which the test suite reports as **XFAIL** — so CI stays
green while work is in progress, and a test turns into a real pass/fail the moment its stub is filled in.

```
pytest -q        # 1 passed, 76 xfailed   <- today
pytest -q        # 77 passed              <- definition of done
```

A complete working version lives on the **`reference`** branch (see [docs/TEAM.md](docs/TEAM.md#reference-branch)).

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest -q                                              # run the acceptance tests
ruff check .                                           # lint
flask --app pdpa_shield.app run --debug                # http://127.0.0.1:5000
